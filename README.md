# Ultimate Tic Tac Toe
# How to Play
Similar to the original tic tac toe, player 1 is represented by an X and player 2 by an O. To start the game player 1 places an X on any of the squares, however after this initial move the players must play in the box that is highlighted yellow, corresponding to the previous square selected by the other player. Each board is won as usual in tic tac toe, by getting three of your symbol in a row, column or diagonal, however to win the whole game three boxes in a row, column or diagonal must be won by the same player.
